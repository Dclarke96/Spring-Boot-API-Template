## Overview

Fleet Management API is a backend service designed to help businesses track vehicles, manage maintenance records, and maintain operational visibility across their fleet.

The API provides secure, scalable RESTful endpoints for managing fleet data, including vehicle management, maintenance tracking, authentication, authorization, search functionality, pagination, and validation.

The project is designed to demonstrate production-oriented backend development practices, including layered architecture, DTO-based API boundaries, security implementation, centralized exception handling, OpenAPI documentation, integration testing, continuous integration, and containerized deployment workflows.

## Quick Start

### Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The application will be available at:

- API: http://localhost:8080
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
- Health Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

### Run Locally

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Once the application starts, access:

- API: http://localhost:8080
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
- Health Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java 17
* **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.4.2
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Validation:** Jakarta Validation
* **Security:** Spring Security + JWT Authentication
* **API Documentation:** SpringDoc OpenAPI / Swagger UI
* **Build Tool:** Gradle
* **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose
* **Architecture:** Layered Architecture with separated API, business logic, persistence, security, and cross-cutting concerns
* **Testing:** JUnit 5 + Spring Boot Test
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

---

## Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture with clear separation between application responsibilities:

```
Controller Layer
        ↓
Service Layer
        ↓
Repository Layer
        ↓
Database
```

Supporting layers include:

* **API Layer** - Provides standardized API responses and pagination models.
* **DTO Layer** - Separates external API contracts from internal persistence models.
* **Security Layer** - Handles JWT authentication, authorization, and current user context.
* **Exception Layer** - Provides centralized exception handling and consistent error responses.
* **Logging Layer** - Provides request logging and traceability.

Key architectural decisions:

* Controllers remain thin and delegate business logic to services.
* Services contain application rules and workflows.
* Repositories manage database access through JPA.
* DTOs protect API contracts from internal entity changes.
* Security concerns are isolated from business logic.

For a detailed overview, see:

* [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)

## API Documentation

The API exposes endpoints for managing:

* User authentication
* Vehicles
* Maintenance records

Supported operations include:

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE
* Search
* Pagination

Detailed endpoint documentation with request and response examples:

* [API Design](docs/api-design.md)

---

## OpenAPI Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available through Swagger UI after starting the application.

### Swagger UI

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

### OpenAPI JSON

```
http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs
```

Swagger UI allows developers to:

* Browse all available endpoints
* View request and response schemas
* Authenticate using JWT bearer tokens
* Execute API requests directly from the browser

---

## Health Monitoring

Spring Boot Actuator is included to provide application health monitoring for local development and production deployments.

Health endpoint:

```
GET /actuator/health
```

When the application is running locally:

```
http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

The endpoint reports application and database health and can be used by deployment platforms, load balancers, or monitoring systems to verify service availability.

---

## Logging

The application uses structured request logging to improve troubleshooting and operational visibility.

Each incoming request is assigned a unique trace identifier that is included throughout the request lifecycle and in standardized error responses. This allows application logs and client-facing errors to be correlated during debugging.

Application logs intentionally exclude sensitive information such as passwords and JWT tokens.

---

## Authentication

The API uses JWT-based authentication.

### Registration

Create a new account:

```
POST /api/auth/register
```

### Login

Authenticate and receive a JWT token:

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

Example authentication header for protected endpoints:

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

Protected resources require a valid authentication token.

### Using Swagger UI

1. Register a new user or log in using:

```
POST /api/auth/register
```

or

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

2. Copy the JWT token returned from the login response.

3. Open Swagger UI and click the **Authorize** button.

4. Enter:

```
Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

5. Execute protected endpoints directly from the documentation.

## Design Decisions

Major architecture and implementation decisions are documented, including:

* Why layered architecture was selected
* Why DTOs are used
* Authentication and authorization strategy
* Validation approach
* Exception handling design
* Repository query design
* Testing strategy

* [Design Decisions](docs/design-decisions.md)

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have:

* Java 17
* PostgreSQL database
* Gradle
* Docker Desktop (optional, for containerized setup)

---

## Environment Configuration

The application uses Spring profiles:

* `local` - Local development environment
* `test` - Automated testing environment
* `prod` - Production environment
* `docker` - Docker container environment

Sensitive configuration values should be provided through environment variables.

Required environment variables vary by active Spring profile.

Copy .env.example to .env (or configure the equivalent environment variables) before starting the application.

### Local Profile

```
DB_PASSWORD=<database-password>
JWT_SECRET=<jwt-secret-key>
```

### Production / Docker Profiles

```
DB_URL=<jdbc-url>
DB_USERNAME=<database-username>
DB_PASSWORD=<database-password>
JWT_SECRET=<jwt-secret-key>
```
